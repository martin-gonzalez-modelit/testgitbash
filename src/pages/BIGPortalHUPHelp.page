                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong>What is new with this portal?</strong></div> The primary goal of this portal is to make it
                easier and more efficient for contractors and raters to submit and process jobs. We have worked on a number of improvements to
                make the website more user friendly, and we will continue to streamline and improve this website in the future.
                </p>


                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong> Where can I find information about performing and submitting Home Upgrades?</strong></div>
                We have many resources to help you get acquainted with Energy Upgrade California&#174; Home Upgrade and Advanced Home Upgrade that can
                help you learn how to submit applications. Please visit the <a href="http://www.homeupgrade.org/resources/documents/">Document Library</a> on <a href="http://www.homeupgrade.org/">homeupgrade.org</a>.
                </p>


                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong> What is the difference between Home Upgrade and Advanced Home Upgrade?</strong></div>
                Home Upgrade focuses on the building shell to minimize loss of the energy consumed to maintain a warmer or cooler indoor environment.
                Improvements may include attic, wall and floor insulation, duct sealing, furnace and AC replacements, and more. Customers can earn rebates of up to $2,500.
                </p>
                <p>
                Advanced Home Upgrade typically starts by improving on the building shell but makes use of &#39;energy-modeling&#39; software to estimate the effectiveness of
                a customized work-scope. Installed measures can include new systems (heating, cooling, and water heaters), replacing ductwork, upgrading to dual-pane windows,
                and more. Customers can earn rebates of up to $6,500.
                </p>


                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong> How long does it take to process a rebate application?</strong></div>
                The average processing time varies by program. It takes on average between 2 to 3 business days to review an application after
                initially submitted. If all details and documents pass review and the application is approved, it can take another 6 to 8 weeks to
                process either the Home Upgrade or Advanced Home Upgrade application through to mailing of a check by PG&amp;E. This is due to the rigorous
                Quality Control sampling and review that occurs for approximately 5% of all applications. However, these are rough averages and actual
                processing times will vary depending on factors such as the completeness of your application, how quickly you submit additional
                information if it is needed, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong> Can I submit a job as both Home Upgrade and Advanced Home Upgrade?</strong></div>
                No. You cannot submit a Home Upgrade rebate application and an Advanced Home Upgrade rebate application at the same time.
                PG&amp;E will not pay a customer twice for the same upgrade measures. A customer may participate more than once in either Home Upgrade or
                Advanced Home Upgrade pathways, but must form work-scopes that include different measures than were rebated in the past.
                </p>


                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong> How do I know if I have to take action on any of my rebate applications?</strong></div>
                For Home Upgrade applications, a &#34;Correction Required&#34; status means that you will have to correct and/or clarify some 
                parts of your application and/or you will have to submit additional information or documents. An email will automatically be sent to
                the portal user that submitted the application when returned for correction.
                </p>
                <p>
                For Advanced Home Upgrade applications, a &#34;Pre-Install Correction Required&#34; or &#34;Post-Install Correction Required&#34; status means that
                you have to correct and/or clarify some part(s) of your application and/or submit additional information or documents. A &#34;Pre-Install Approved&#34;
                status means that your pre-installation application has been approved and you may complete the job and submit a post-installation
                application. An email will automatically be sent to the portal user that submitted the application when an application status changes to any of those status mentioned above.
                </p>

                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong>Where can I see a list of all my customers?</strong></div>
                You can see a list of your customers under the &#34;Buildings&#34; tab in the main site navigation. Please note that it is possible
                to have multiple buildings for one owner and each building will be a separate record in the listing.
                </p>

                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong>Why canâ€™t I see all of my old jobs?</strong></div>
                If you have applications that you created in Green Energy Compass, they will be migrated to this new portal
                in early 2015. During the transition, you will not be able to log in to Green Energy Compass to manage or view your jobs.
                However, you will be able to view your old applications in this new portal in the future. Open, active applications that are unable to
                reach &#34;Full-Application Submitted&#34; status in Green Energy Compass by December 12, 2014 must be migrated to the new portal by the participating portal user.
                </p>

                <p>
                <div class="sub-title"><strong>What documents do I need to provide with my rebate application?</strong></div>
                The documents that you need to provide vary somewhat by program. Below are lists of the typical documents that you&#39;ll need to upload for each program.
                </p>
